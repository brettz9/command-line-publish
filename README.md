# command-line-publish

Tool to convert [`command-line-args`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/command-line-args)/[`command-line-usage`](https://github.com/75lb/command-line-usage/)
JSON arrays to SVG or HTML.

## Install

```shell
npm install -D command-line-publish
```

## Usage

```shell
command-line-publish <args>
```

or:

```shell
clp <args>
```

And here is the documentation generated by our use of `command-line-publish` on itself.

First as HTML--which has the advantage that its contents are copy-pasteable:

- [cli.html](https://brettz9.github.io/command-line-publish/cli.html)

And then as embeddable SVG:

[![cli.svg](https://brettz9.github.io/command-line-publish/cli.svg)](cli.svg)

After using the commands to generate, you can:

- Link to the HTML, e.g., as we did above: `[cli.html](https://brettz9.github.io/command-line-publish/cli.html)`
- Embed the SVG, e.g., as we did above: `[![cli.svg](https://brettz9.github.io/command-line-publish/cli.svg)](cli.svg)`
