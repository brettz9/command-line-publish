And here is the documentation generated by our use of `command-line-publish` on itself.

First as HTML--which has the advantage that its contents are copy-pasteable:

- [cli.html](https://brettz9.github.io/command-line-publish/cli.html)

And then as embeddable SVG:

[![cli.svg](https://brettz9.github.io/command-line-publish/cli.svg)](cli.svg)

After using the commands to generate, you can:

- Link to the HTML, e.g., as we did above: `[cli.html](https://brettz9.github.io/command-line-publish/cli.html)`
- Embed the SVG, e.g., as we did above: `[![cli.svg](https://brettz9.github.io/command-line-publish/cli.svg)](cli.svg)`
